                <h2>to the love of my life</h2>
                <h3>Imen Ajroudi</h3>
                <p>
                To the one whom I admire the most,
                To the one who gave a meaning to my life,
                I don't think words like love or admire are enough for me to describe how I feel towards you.
                That innocent smile when you see me ahhh, I can't get enough of it.
                Today is your birthday, and I'd like to take the opportunity
                to thank God for what He created
                a walking angel, as you said to me (HAHA), with the purest soul ever.
                Each time you fall in love, look at the sunsetZ.
                There's truly a memory flash reminding us that we are Young & Dumb.
                shouting that When we kiss, it's an APOCALYPSE.
                K.?
